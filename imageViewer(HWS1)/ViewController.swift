// This project is intented to display 10 images, with text below them. It will use a table view controller, and then a detail view controller to display the image and the text.
// The information will be hard coded and then stored in the file structure, where it will be accessed. I WON'T make them objects as such, but instead numbered arrays.
//The key thing will be passign the information between the two view controllers. This is something that I want to practice.

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
